# Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project uses decision trees and random forests to classify forest cover types based on cartographic features from the Roosevelt National Forest dataset.

## Project Structure

- `data/covtype.csv` - Raw dataset from Kaggle
- `data/clean_covtype.csv` - Cleaned and preprocessed version
- `scripts/forest_model.py` - All data analysis and modeling code
- `outputs/plots/` - Visualizations of the data and results

## Tools Used

- Python (Spyder IDE)
- pandas
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Goals

- Explore relationships between environmental features and forest cover
- Build a model to predict cover types
- Communicate results clearly and visually
